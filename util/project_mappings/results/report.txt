Plan: Do 1 quick pass to gain familiarity with projects and get an idea of what Apache and RedHat assign as domains/categories. Then, 

Apache
-Amount of #issues>=1000 projects: 187
-Problems with language:
	-INFRA: Not sure this has a language/project that matters, seems like just housekeeping.
	-Apache Qpid: Lots of different repositories, main language does not seem to be Java. Not sure what it is, though.
	-Apache Guacamole: has a server in C and a client in Java.
-There are 52 projects with undocumented domains. Not sure how to assign them to these projects without guesswork.

RedHat
-Amount of #issues>=1000 projects: 97
-Need to go through everything for OpenShift projects at some point. All the same stuff likely.
-Name == null: 2
-Repo == null: 42
-Website == null: 40
-Domain == null: 57
-Language == null: 46

Other
-The Atlassian (ecosystem: Jira) projects are very hard to find the correct repos for. Not sure if they're on github at all.
