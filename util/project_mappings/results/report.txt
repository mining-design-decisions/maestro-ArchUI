Plan: Do 1 quick pass to gain familiarity with projects and get an idea of what Apache and RedHat assign as domains/categories. Then, 

Apache
-Amount of #issues>=1000 projects: 187
-Problems with language:
	-INFRA: Not sure this has a language/project that matters, seems like just housekeeping.
	-Apache Qpid: Lots of different repositories, main language does not seem to be Java. Not sure what it is, though.
	-Apache Guacamole: has a server in C and a client in Java.
-There are 52 projects with undocumented domains. Not sure how to assign them to these projects without guesswork.

RedHat
-Amount of #issues>=1000 projects: 97
-Need to go through everything for OpenShift projects at some point. All the same stuff likely.

Other
-Amount of #issues>=1000 projects: 116
-The Atlassian (ecosystem: Jira) projects are very hard to find the correct repos for. Not sure if they're on github at all. Wondering if the researchers who originally composed this DB got just open Jiras or Open Source.
-The Qt projects are seemingly used as bug reports, not development? Potentially very low amount of architecture here. Putting C++ on all projects by default.
-MongoDB: A lot of projects have their repos linked in jira.
-Spring has migrated everything to GitHub.
-Mojang: Not open source, are bug trackers.
-JiraEcosystem: Same problem as Atlassian
